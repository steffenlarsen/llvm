https://github.com/intel/llvm/issues


== Dependencies

This extension is written against the SYCL 2020 revision 9 specification.  All
references below to the "core SYCL specification" or to section numbers in the
SYCL specification refer to that revision.

This extension also depends on the following other SYCL extensions:

* link:../experimental/sycl_ext_oneapi_enqueue_functions.asciidoc[
  sycl_ext_oneapi_enqueue_functions]
* link:../experimental/sycl_ext_oneapi_properties.asciidoc[
  sycl_ext_oneapi_enqueue_properties]


== Status

This is an experimental extension specification, intended to provide early
access to features and gather community feedback.  Interfaces defined in this
specification are implemented in {dpcpp}, but they are not finalized and may
change incompatibly in future versions of {dpcpp} without prior notice.
*Shipping software products should not rely on APIs defined in this
specification.*


== Backend support status

This extension is currently implemented in {dpcpp} only for all device targets.

== Overview

On some backends, calling `wait()` on a `sycl::event` will synchronize using a
busy-waiting implementation. Though this comes at a low latency for the
synchronization of the event, it has the downside of consuming high amounts of
CPU time for no meaningful work.  This extension introduces a new property for
`sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental::barrier()` that will produce a "low-power"
event. These new low-power events will, if possible, yield the thread that the
`wait()` member function is called on and only wake up occasionally to check if
the event has finished. This reduces the time the CPU spends checking finish
condition of the wait, at the cost of latency.


== Specification

=== Feature test macro

This extension provides a feature-test macro as described in the core SYCL
specification.  An implementation supporting this extension must predefine the
macro `sycl_ext_intel_low_power_event` to one of the values defined in the table
below.  Applications can test for the existence of this macro to determine if
the implementation supports this feature, or applications can test the macro's
value to determine which of the extension's features the implementation
supports.

=== Interrupt identifiers

This extension adds the `interrupt_id` class. This follows the common reference
semantics, as described in {common_ref_sem}[section 4.5.2.] of the SYCL 2020
specification and is defined as:

```
namespace sycl::ext::intel::experimental {

class interrupt_id {
public:
  interrupt_id() = delete;

  /* -- common interface members -- */
};

}
```

To create an `interrupt_id` object, the user must first create the corresponding
backend-specific object directly through the corresponding backend and then use
the following `make_interrupt_id` to create the `interrupt_id` object.

```
namespace sycl::ext::intel::experimental {

template <backend Backend>
platform make_interrupt_id(const backend_input_t<Backend, interrupt_id>& backendObject);

}
```


=== Low-power event property

This extension also adds a new property which can be used with the `barrier`
and `partial_barrier` enqueue free functions from
link:../experimental/sycl_ext_oneapi_enqueue_functions.asciidoc[sycl_ext_oneapi_enqueue_functions].
Passing this property to either of these functions will act as a hint to the
`event` created from the corresponding commands to do low-power synchronization.
If the backend is able to handle low-power events, calling `event::wait()` or
`event::wait_and_throw()` will cause the thread to yield and only do occasional
wake-ups to check the event progress.  The `low_power_event` property takes an
optional `interrupt_id` argument, indicating an interrupt for the wait.

```
struct low_power_event {
  low_power_event(interrupt_id ID);
  low_power_event();

  const std::optional<interrupt_id> value;
};

using low_power_event_key = low_power_event;

inline bool operator==(const low_power_event &LHS, const low_power_event &RHS) {
  return LHS.value == RHS.value;
}
inline bool operator!=(const low_power_event &LHS, const low_power_event &RHS) {
  return !(LHS == RHS);
}
```

TODO: Mention the requirement that interrupt_id is managed by the user and
      that it should not release after .wait on all events created using a
      barrier with a property using is returns.
